Each of these files runs a simulation from the paper.
Note that many simulations use multiple cores; you may need to modify this for your machine.

OTHER FILES

makeMxDist.R: shows how we made the metabolomics dataset distribution for edge weight sampling. You cannot run this as the raw data cannot be published; the purpose is just to show how we did it. This file generates the file mxDist.csv from the raw data.

generateSimGraphs_simD.R

simulations_master.R

simulations_config.R

errorMetrics.R: Utility file that contains the functions used for assessing model performance
