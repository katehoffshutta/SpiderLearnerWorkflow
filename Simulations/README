SIMULATION R SCRIPTS

Each of these R scripts runs a simulation from the paper and is called by a shell script that includes LSF parameters.
Please look at the corresponding shell scripts; you will need to adjust if you are not running LSF.
Note that many simulations use multiple cores; you may need to modify this for your machine. 

simulations_A.R # requires 40 cores

simulations_B.R # requires 40 cores

simulations_C.R # requires 40 cores

Note: Simulation D was split up into three processes so that it could be run across several different nodes at once
because of the higher computing cost associated with the high-dimensional setting.

simulations_D_a.R # requires 40 cores
simulations_D_b.R # requires 40 cores
simulations_D_c.R # requires 20 cores

kfoldStudy.R: study sensitivity to the number of folds k in the cross-validation # requires 50 cores

librarySensitivityStudy.R: study library sensitivity in simulation setting # requires 10 cores

ovarianLibraryStudy.R: study library sensitivity in ovarian cancer setting # requires 10 cores

mleStudy.R: study how graph density affects the weight of the MLE in the SpiderLearner ensemble # requires 10 cores

runtimeStudy.R: look at runtime for various n,p # requires 10 cores

OTHER FILES

makeMxDist.R: shows how we made the metabolomics dataset distribution for edge weight sampling. You cannot run this as the raw data cannot be published; the purpose is just to show how we did it. This file generates the file mxDist.csv from the raw data.

generateSimGraphs.R 

generateSimGraphs_simD.R

getBenchmarkNets.R: calls generateSimGraphs.R and generateSimGraphs_simD.R to generate the gold standard networks

simulations_master.R

simulations_config.R

errorMetrics.R: Utility file that contains the functions used for assessing model performance
